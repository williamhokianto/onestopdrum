Yamaha Tour Custom drum sets have been created with all maple shells&nbsp;that are 6-ply (5.6mm), the all maple shells allow for warmth and brightness. A significantly all-purpose shell material that can produce an even amount of highs and mids with somewhat warm lows that are really felt in the midst of a performance. Each and every drum within the&nbsp;Yamaha Tour Custom 20\" Fusion 4 Piece Shell Pack features 45 degree bearing edges, this feature adds tonal depth and super fast response, not only that the sustain you achieve measured just perfectly.</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\"><font face=\"Arial\">The&nbsp;Tour Custom Series is available in&nbsp;five&nbsp;stunning satin lacquer&nbsp;finishes, each with their own unique appeal. The all new colours from Yamaha truly&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;the sonic potential of the maple shell, they don\'t only look beautiful, they perform beautifully too. Available in two size configurations, both of which are 4-piece shell packs with Triple Mount Tom Holders included.</font></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">The Yamaha Enhanced Sustain System (Y.E.S.S) mounts have been create to decrease contact between the shell and the mount, this in turn makes for a more varied and dynamic range and longer sustain. The Inverse Dyna Hoop and Yamaha\'s Exclusive Absolute Lugs are also features which make this Tour Custom a drum kit to be reckoned with. The Inverse Dyna Hoop aids natural overtones and focusses in on the core tones of the shell whilst the Absolute Lugs, exclusive to Yamaha and ever so stylish and distinctive, adding that final touch of finesse to a very&nbsp;stylish set&nbsp;of drums.</font></p><h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px;

Yes it has been played on but by the master himself making this a pretty special drum kit indeed. When Yamaha decided to design the hybrid maple snare drum, they thought about the most important thing of all... the sound. No matter what you play, this Yamaha drum kit is everything you need and more! With it\'s Hybrid maple drum shell with a center Wenge ply, this 4-piece drum kit is great in all situations whether you\'re playing live, recording or just practicing. The vintage natural shell really is a thing of beauty and feels immensely good to play with it\'s lovely warm tone and outstanding projection, this maple drum kit is truly amazing!</font></p><h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px;

Inspired by Yamaha\'s celebrated Absolute Hybrid Maple Kit with strong Japanese undertones, Yamaha have adopted the Japanese ethos of wanting to deliver the courage and ability drawn from Japanese culture fused with the high quality outcomes the brand are known for. In so the Yamaha Exclusive 50th Anniversary Acoustic Drum Kit was born, a limited edition collector\'s shell pack&nbsp;that is dripping with timeless Yamaha beauty.&nbsp;</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">Yamaha have forged their way through the percussion industry since 1967 and have left behind a trail of unquestionable attention to detail, quality artistry and a queue&nbsp;of prestigious followers. This kit is undeniably representative of Yamaha\'s standing in the drumming industry over the last 50 years, an impressive standing considering they are a relatively young brand in comparison to other drumming industry heavyweights. The anniversary kit will always&nbsp;<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">mark this monumental occasion and will&nbsp;</span>hold a special laser cut 50th anniversary badge to signify its importance.</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">A&nbsp;beautifully unique, phoenix design engulfs the bass drum head and is complimented by a stunning exotic Birdseye Maple hybrid shell, finished in the dense, mesmerising Amber Shadow finish. Deliciously textured,&nbsp;the hybrid maple shell is an all purpose shell that provides excellent stick response and bends to a wide range of playing styles, perfect for a variety genres. Maple also has the ability to produce warm, rich lows and even amounts of highs and mids.&nbsp;<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">A truly versatile sound that suits many different types of genre with an impeccable ability to perform wherever you place it.&nbsp;</span>The fascinating Amber Shadow finish is classically traditional in it\'s appearance and is complimented by durable aluminium die cast chrome hoops, gold hook lugs and an impressive laser etched wood/aluminium hybrid Yamaha badge which accompanies each drum. All of these features combined make for a timeless&nbsp;feel which pays homage to the drum kits of 1980\'s and it has all the fantastic qualities too. Durable, dependable and down right special, this kit is a total one of a kind.</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">YESS III Tom Mounts are&nbsp;designed to reduce acoustic dampening, this lets the hybrid shell vibrate for longer, in turn generating an enhanced sound that is overly more&nbsp;powerful. It also allows for improved volume output and high sustain levels. Hook lugs have a polished, refined golden finish that matches perfectly with the Amber Shadow finish of the shell. Precise tuning, as well as quick and easy head replacement is easily achieved with these lugs. Included alongside this one of a kind acoustic drum kit is an embroidered 50th Anniversary Case Protection Racket case, this is only available within the UK and therefore we are very lucky to be able to offer this added bonus to you as well.&nbsp;</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">Luxury doesn\'t even come close, this acoustic kit is is beautifully crafted, but unfortunately it&nbsp;won\'t be around forever.

This stunning drum kit is fitted with 100% birch high-class shells and upgraded hardware in order to deliver the best playing experience. Also, this amazing drum kit features the YESS (Yamaha Enhanced Sustain System) which has a double role: It provides a minimum contact between the shell and the hardware and the nylon bushings on the rod clamps offer maximum stability. Another amazing feature of this drum kit is the ball mount and clamp which is offering a non-slip positioning and it allows tuning the bottom head just by simply rotating the drum. This awesome drum kit comes along with the 600 Series Hardware which contains 2 double braced short boom cymbal stands, 1 Hi Hat stand, 1 snare drum stand and a foot pedal. The cymbals are NOT included.</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration-line: underline;\"><em style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\"><font face=\"Arial\">NEW colours!

You would think you are playing a much more expensive drum kit when you get behind the Silverstar. Made from carefully selected birch which has been utilised by using the same molding methods as the high end drum kits. Combining tradition, excellence and affordability to deliver everything you would want from a Tama drum kit.

You would think you are playing a much more expensive drum kit when you get behind the Silverstar. Made from carefully selected birch which has been utilised by using the same molding methods as the high end drum kits. Combining tradition, excellence and affordability to deliver everything you would want from a Tama drum kit. If you are looking for a 5-Piece drum kit that has been designed and built to last and also comes with double braced hardware pack (see below) then this beautiful Tama Silverstar in Piano White will serve you well on every performance.

The Tama Starclassic&nbsp;drum kits are also available with different shell materials, but the Bubinga drum shells are around&nbsp;53% harder than your typical maple and birch shells and are known to deliver a sharp attack with rich and fat lows.</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">If you\'re a fan of new features, you\'ll love the Starclassic series as they&nbsp;currently&nbsp;have two&nbsp;patent and one pending patent parts included; The lightweight, aluminium Star-Cast Mounting System is found on all of Tama\'s top-end drums. The Star-Cast Mount allows you to position your toms close together without getting in the way, whilst ensuring your tom can reach it\'s full potential and&nbsp;maximum resonance.</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">The Patent Hold Tight Washers basically do what they say!

A brand new range for 2017, these drumsticks retain all the Pro-Mark qualities we know and love but with one added benefit, each and every FireGrain drumstick is put through a heat-tempering process which turns ordinary hickory sticks into FireGrain sticks, capable of unrivalled precision and the utmost durability. They are certainly on fire, maybe not literally but your playing style will definitely be and for all the right reasons.</font></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">FireGrain drumsticks have a hickory base, h<span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">ickory</span><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;sticks are renowned for providing extra rebound and being extremely durable, the oval wood&nbsp;tips typically produce a large and diverse range of sound, whilst it\'s wooden base provides a full, warm and undeniably rich range of sound. These Pro-Mark drumsticks&nbsp;</span>are incredibly durable with a medium weight and this is even before the FireGrain heat tempering has taken place, so can you imagine the durability that is pouring out of these drumsticks once the heat tempering process has been applied. One incredibly attractive quality of these drumsticks is that although they\'ve been heat-tempered, all of the original qualities that make Pro-Mark so desirable are retained even after the heat-tempering. The original weight, balance and attack are all the same, as well as the 16\" length and 0.630\" diameter. Each and every pair of Pro-Mark drumsticks are designed and manufactured in the USA under scrupulous quality controls and the Classic 2B FireGrain sized drumsticks are no different. The 2B sized drumstick are thick in size and are ideal for marching and concert band use, a classic size that most drummers have in their drumming essentials kit bag because it really is a classic! A classic with a twist of fire!</font></p><h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;

The Vintage Series from Sonor celebrates the sound, the look and the feel of those vintage kits that made Sonor so iconic back in the 1950\'s.

Stability and capability are key benefits to using a snare with Tune Safe technology. Redesigned Superprofil triple flanged hoops, have been created to reflect the vintage style hoops that were used within vintage kits, the 2.3mm triple flanged steel hoops have a traditional shape which hugs the snare drum, a shape that was super popular with Sonor during the 1950\'s and 70\'s.</font></p><h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px;

It comes fitted with a&nbsp;6-ply, premium hand-selected Birch wood shell in a beautiful Silky Black Finish along with chrome hardware. The snare drum also features a round 45 degree bearing edge,</span>&nbsp;vintage Phonic lugs,&nbsp;S-Hoops on the top side, and a special open, triple-flanged steel hoop on the bottom.&nbsp;Gavin loved the benefits of the new Dual Glide Snare System, but took the idea a little further by leaving an open bottom hoop which makes the Dual Glide strainer even more versatile, as multiple snare wires can be used and exchanged quickly. Please note the Standard edition does not include extra snare wire and hard case. Snare drum comes as pictured.</font></p><h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(24, 24, 24); letter-spacing: 0.1em; text-transform: uppercase; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">FEATURES:</font></h3><ul style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none outside; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-type: disc; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);\"><font face=\"Arial\">Chrome Plated hardware</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-type: disc; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);\"><font face=\"Arial\">6-ply birch shell</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-type: disc; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);\"><font face=\"Arial\">TuneSafe lugs configuration</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-type: disc; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);\"><font face=\"Arial\">Snare strainer with Dual Glide System</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-type: disc; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);\"><font face=\"Arial\">Hybrid Bearing Edges;</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-type: disc; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);\"><font face=\"Arial\">Vintage round on top, modern 45 degree on bottom</font></li></ul><h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(24, 24, 24); letter-spacing: 0.1em; text-transform: uppercase; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><font face=\"Arial\">CODE:</font></h3><ul style=\"margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none outside; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 23px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-type: disc; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);\"><font face=\"Arial\">SG11177301</font></li></ul>', '8_bd6e7c14-6287-4706-983a-698c8166178b.jpg', '8_bd6e7c14-6287-4706-983a-698c8166178b.jpg', '0.00', 1),

Reinforcement rings and single flanged hoops give off that&nbsp;retro&nbsp;vibe whilst still harnessing the modern technology and style of the 21st century! Articulate and capable of producing a decent range of warm lows and an even amount of mids-highs, this snare may be crafted using all purpose maple, but it\'s North American maple and that makes all the difference. As standard, Design Lab snare drums feature Puresound 16 strand wires, which are evenly spaced to create an even balance response and reaction. A fabulous snare drum to play, to look at and to listen to, you know what they say about the equinox they may be rare but they\'re well worth the wait.</font></p><h3 style=\"margin: 0px 0px 8px; padding: 0px;
